# Benisploy

**Benisploy** is an open-source, AI-agentic PaaS that turns a bare VPS into a self-hosted app platform. Guided by a conversational AI agent, anyone can deploy, manage, and recover apps without touching a terminal — powered by a deterministic orchestration engine grounded in Docker Compose.

## Monorepo Structure

```
/apps
  /web                       # SvelteKit + TS + Bun — dashboard UI and control-plane API, one deployable
  /node-agent                 # Go module — installed on each managed VPS
/packages
  /monitor-schemas             # shared JSON/Zod schemas for control-plane <-> node monitor
  /tool-schemas                 # JSON schema for orchestrator tools (source of truth for AI agent)
/templates                    # curated app catalog (future)
/deploy                       # compose file / install script (future)
